# Damian Bartus - Mechatronics Engineer
## 📖 About Me

Hi, I'm a Mechatronics Engineer with a passion for turning ideas into functional, tested solutions. I thrive in the full development cycle — from concept and design to prototyping and final validation — combining mechanical design, electronics, and software into cohesive systems.

My interests span across rapid prototyping, additive manufacturing, robotics, and automation. I’m particularly drawn to the innovation happening at the intersection of these fields. Outside of engineering, I enjoy real-time strategy and first-person shooter games.

## 🔧 Technical Expertise

I’ve worked with both **FDM** and **SLA 3D printing technologies**, including building and tuning my own FDM 3D printer. I’m also the proud builder of a self-made CNC router, allowing me to explore subtractive and additive processes side by side.

Here are some of the tools and platforms I use regularly:

### Mechanical & CAD
- SolidWorks  
- Autodesk Inventor  
- AutoCAD  
- PLM & PDM systems
- CNC programming

### Software & Programming
- Python  
- C++  
- Git  
- Docker  
- Linux  

### Robotics & Simulation
- ROS  
- Gazebo  
- Isaac Sim  

### Game Engines & Visualization
- Unity  
- Unreal Engine  

## Academic Projects

- **Bachelor's Thesis:** *Simulation of Machining Using Industrial Robots* — focused on digital twins and robotic machining simulations.  
- **Master’s Thesis (in progress):** *Automation in Additive Manufacturing* — digital twin of 3D printing workflow. Automation of 3D printing process using ROS and Isaac Sim for simulation of MIR platform and UR robot.

## 📌 Featured Projects

### 🔹 [FDM 3D Printer](./fdm-3d-printer/README.md)
Custom-built **FDM 3D printer** inspired by the RatRig design. It utilizes **CoreXY kinematics** for high-speed and precise movement, and runs on **Klipper firmware** for enhanced control and performance.

### 🔹 [CNC Router](./cnc-router/README.md)
A low-cost **3-axis CNC router** designed for machining plastic sheets. Built using **V-slot extrusions**, this router is powered by **NEMA 23 stepper motors** and controlled via **GRBL**.

### 🔹 [Additive manufacturing](./additive-manufacturing/README.md)
3D printing is technology that fascinates me. Ability to create parts on demand is something that i find very useful. It allows me to create custom parts for my projects, and experiment with new designs. I love ability to fix problems with custom parts.

### 🔹 [Additive manufacturing automation](./additive-manufacturing-automation/README.md)
**Master thesis project** i'm currently working on. Will utilize Isaac Sim and ROS to control MIR platform with mounted UR10. My goal is to create system that will be able to produce parts on demand. First i will create **digital twin** of system, then it will be transfered to real world.

### 🔹 [Simulation of Machining Using Industrial Robots](./robot-machining-sim/README.md)
A **Unity-based** simulation developed as part of an **engineering degree project**. This simulator replicates **machining with an industrial robot**, specifically the **KUKA KR60 HA**. Simulator uses custom 6-axis Inverse Kinematics solver for calculating joint positions. To simulate machining operations, Marching Cubes Algorithm is used. Calculations are performed on GPU. Model is devided to chunks to improve optymization.

### 🔹 [Bog'Leesh - A Gamejam Adventure](./Bog-Leesh/README.md)
**Bog'Leesh** is a game developed using **Unreal Engine**, where players navigate through a series of **physics-based puzzles and challenges**. Set in a **whimsical world**. With **intuitive controls** and **engaging gameplay mechanics**.

### 🔹 [Camera Slider & Controller for Hydroponics](./camera-slider/README.md)
This project is a **custom-built camera slider** designed to monitor plants in a **hydroponic system**. The system features a **gantry-style slider** with a **SCARA arm** for close-up plant monitoring. The movement is controlled by a **MicroPython-based controller** running on a **Raspberry Pi Pico**.

### 🔹 [Skryba Bot](./skryba-bot/README.md)
Skryba Bot is a simple Discord bot made for fun. The bot is capable of citing **predefined quotes** both in **text** and **voice**, making conversations more engaging.
