# Portfolio

Welcome to my project portfolio! This repository showcases my past projects.

## 📌 Featured Projects

### 🔹 [FDM 3D Printer](./fdm-3d-printer/README.md)
Custom-built **FDM 3D printer** inspired by the RatRig design. It utilizes **CoreXY kinematics** for high-speed and precise movement, and runs on **Klipper firmware** for enhanced control and performance.

### 🔹 [CNC Router](./cnc-router/README.md)
A low-cost **3-axis CNC router** designed for machining plastic sheets. Built using **V-slot extrusions**, this router is powered by **NEMA 23 stepper motors** and controlled via **GRBL**.

### 🔹 [Simulation of Omnidirectional Robotic Platform](./omni-robot-sim/README.md)
A virtual robotic platform simulated in **Gazebo**, controlled via **ROS**, using **mecanum wheels** for omnidirectional movement.

### 🔹 [Simulation of Machining Using Industrial Robots](./robot-machining-sim/README.md)
A **Unity-based** simulation developed as part of an **engineering degree project**. This simulator replicates **machining with an industrial robot**, specifically the **KUKA KR60 HA**. Simulator uses custom 6-axis Inverse Kinematics solver for calculating joint positions. To simulate machining operations, Marching Cubes Algorithm is used. Calculations are performed on GPU. Model is devided to chunks to improve optymization.

### 🔹 [Bog'Leesh - A Gamejam Adventure](./Bog-Leesh/README.md)
**Bog'Leesh** is a game developed using **Unreal Engine**, where players navigate through a series of **physics-based puzzles and challenges**. Set in a **whimsical world**. With **intuitive controls** and **engaging gameplay mechanics**.

### 🔹 [Camera Slider & Controller for Hydroponics](./camera-slider/README.md)
This project is a **custom-built camera slider** designed to monitor plants in a **hydroponic system**. The system features a **gantry-style slider** with a **SCARA arm** for close-up plant monitoring. The movement is controlled by a **MicroPython-based controller** running on a **Raspberry Pi Pico**.

### 🔹 [Skryba Bot](./skryba-bot/README.md)
Skryba Bot is a simple Discord bot made for fun. The bot is capable of citing **predefined quotes** both in **text** and **voice**, making conversations more engaging.
