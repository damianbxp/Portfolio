# 🎥 Camera Slider & Controller for Hydroponics

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **custom-built camera slider** designed to monitor plants in a **hydroponic system**. The system features a **gantry-style slider** with a **SCARA arm** for close-up plant monitoring. The movement is controlled by a **MicroPython-based controller** running on a **Raspberry Pi Pico**.

## 🔧 Hardware Features
- **Gantry System**: V-slot extrusions for construction and linear guides
- **Axes & Motion System**:
  - **X-Axis**: GT2 belts for smooth movement
  - **Z-Axis**: Trapezoidal screw for vertical motion
  - **SCARA Arm**: Arm for Y axis control.
- **Actuators**:
  - **Stepper Motors**: NEMA 17 for precise motion control
  - **Servos**: SCARA arm powered my servos
- **Camera**: Raspberry Pi Camera mounted on the end of the SCARA arm for plant monitoring
